int func(int N,int *weight,int S)
{
-&gt;N means the number of weights left
-&gt;weight is an array containing the weights
-&gt;S we need to achieve this weight
-&gt;Handle termination cases

-&gt;option1. Donot keep weight[N-1] in basket
  which means we need to attain 
  S from the next N-1 weights 
  so call func(N-1,weight,S);
-&gt;option2. keep weight[N-1] in basket 
  which means we need to attain
  S-weight[N-1] next N-1 weights
  so call func(N-1,weight,S-weight[N-1]);

return the sum of the above solutions
}

int main(){
-&gt;scan the input
-&gt;call the function with 
  appropriate parameters
}
