      Hint1:
             How many ways are there inorder to 
             get a weight W using 2^0,2^1,...,2^(N-1)
             weights.Formulate the problem
             mathematically.
      Hint2:
            Mathematical Formulation: How many tuples
            x1,x2,x3,...,xN are there such that
            x1*2^0+x2*2^1+x3*2^2+...+xN *2^(N-1) = W
            and x1>=0 , x2>=0,...xN>=0.
      Hint3:
            We reformulate the task in a slightly different
            way. How many ways can we achieve a weight W
            given that we can choose any weights from 
            2^i,2^(i+1),..2^(N-1). Suppose we choose x(i)
            number of weights of type 2^i we would need to 
            achieve a weight of W-x(i)*2^i from 2^(i+1),2^(i+2),
            ...,2^(N-1) which leads us to the simple recursive 
            equation no_ways[W][i] = sigma(no_ways[W-x*2^i][i+1])
            , x varies from 0 to W/2^i
